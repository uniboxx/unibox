  <h1>The short story of Margherita</h1>
  <p>
    Margherita lives in a small village surrounded by a lush forest. She's a
    strong believer in renewable energy and has installed a 10kw photovoltaic
    plant on her roof. The plant is made up of 40 solar panels and is connected
    to a 10kwh battery. The battery is used to store the energy produced by the
    plant during the day, so that Margherita can use it at night or when the sun
    isn't shining. This way, Margherita is able to reduce her carbon footprint
    and do her part in protecting the planet.
